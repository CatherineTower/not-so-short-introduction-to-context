\startchapter[title=Index of commands]

  The commands discussed in this introduction are listed in this index. Some are simply mentioned, almost in passing, in which case the page that appears in the index indicates where they are mentioned. But other commands are the subject of some more detailed explanation. In this case, only the place where the detailed explanation begins is listed in the index, although the command may be cited in other places in the introduction as well.

  Not included in the index:

  \startitemize

  \item The \tex{stopSomething} that close a construction previously opened with \tex{startSomething}, unless the text says something special about the \tex{stop} command, or is treated at a different location than the one where the corresponding \tex{start} command is.

  \item Commands aimed at generating symbols, all found in \in{Appendix}[app:symbols].
    
  \item In the case of commands that generate a diacritic or letter, and that have an upper case and a lower case version, to generate the upper case or lower case letter respectively, only the lower case version is included.
